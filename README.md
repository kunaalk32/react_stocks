This project is a robinhood.com(https://robinhood.com/) clone. In the future, it should serve as a front end interface to my Stock Portfolio Optimizer. Enter the stock ticker symbols in the box and have the historical prices overlaid on the graph.

## Folder Structure

After creation, your project should look like this:

```
my-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    App.css
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.css
    index.js
    logo.svg
```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

You can delete or rename the other files.

## Running the Project
Inside the project folder on terminal, type `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
